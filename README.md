# Rasa-Grounding-LLM
Rasa-Grounding-LLM aim to Rasa-Grounding-LLM is a powerful project that combines Rasa, a leading open-source conversational AI framework, with a TypeDB database to create an intelligent chatbot agent. This repository provides a comprehensive solution for translating user questions into database queries and seamlessly converting the query results back into natural language responses.

By integrating Rasa with TypeDB, Rasa-Grounding-LLM enables the chatbot agent to understand user intents, extract relevant entities, and generate precise queries to interact with the TypeDB database. The system acts as a mediator, allowing users to ask complex questions and receive meaningful responses by leveraging the expressive power of both Rasa's natural language processing capabilities and the semantic graph database of TypeDB.

This repository offers a well-structured codebase that includes Rasa configurations, custom actions, and database connectivity modules, facilitating the development and deployment of the Rasa agent. It also provides detailed documentation and examples to help users quickly understand and utilize the system's functionalities.

Whether you're building a virtual assistant, a knowledge base search tool, or any application requiring conversational interactions with a TypeDB database, Rasa-Grounding-LLM serves as a reliable foundation. It empowers developers to create intelligent agents that effortlessly bridge the gap between natural language understanding, query translation, and natural language generation.
